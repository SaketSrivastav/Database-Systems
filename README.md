# CS 6400 Database Systems and Design
In this course all the database concepts, techniques and tools that are needed to develop a database application from scratch were introduced. Database concepts learnt in this course includes: Information Flow Model, Extended Entity Relationship Model, the Relational Model, Relational algebra, calculus and SQL, database normalization, efficiency and indexing, and tools for metadata management and archival. This course had four tests and a project.  

As a class project, I applied the techniques learnt in this course to analyze, specify, design, and implement a data warehouse application for an up-and-coming computer and electronics store called S&E’s Technology Superstore. This project was proceeded in three phases:

**•	Analysis & Specification (Phase 1):** Assessed company’s requirements and created Information Flow (IFD) diagram, Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram, and a preliminary requirements analysis report which covered data types, business logic constraints, task decomposition, and abstract/pseudo code. <br />

**•	Design (Phase 2):** Made changes to the EER and IFD from Phase 1 (upon receiving feedback) and converted the abstract code from Phase 1 to SQL code that will be used in the data warehouse application development in Phase 3. <br />

**•	Implementation and Testing (Phase 3):** Created the final data warehouse application using Shiny RStudio and PostgreSQL. Below is a preview of the final application. <br />
